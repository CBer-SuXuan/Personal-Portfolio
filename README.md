# Minecraft Plugin Portfolio

This repository contains the plugins that I have made so far. Although they are small plugins, I think it can show my ability on plugin making!

## Personal description

My name is SuXuan, a Chinese nickname. My IGN(in game name) is CBer_SuXuan. Age is 22, and my Discord is cber_suxuan. I have made plugins for two years and I think I still need to study hard on plugins. From my start of making plugins, many server owners and other people helped me a lot. I like coding and I want become a developer one day in future. These plugins are only made by me on my spare time. I can make plugins for you free or paid, just depend on you. I don't care about how much I can get from making plugins because I love it. Meanwhile, my learning ability is very good that I can learn something very fast. If you think my portfolio is good and think I can code for you, I would very appreciate it. By the way, because I have a very very important examination at the end of 2023, so I can't spend lots of time on making plugins. Please forgive me and nice to meet you!

## Details are as followed:

### Small plugins:

- **BackPack**: Player can have their own pack to **store items**. And there are different tiers that player can have different slot amount.
- **ChangeServer**: BungeeCord plugin. It will allow players join in the specified server if other servers suddenly stop. Avoid making player rejoin the server.
- **CustomInfo**: BungeeCord plugin. Allow you to change **motd, max player, info in front of the server icon, hower info** to what you want, even it can use color on them!
- **HeartCraft**: A easy plugin for server. When you eat golden apple / enchant golden apple, it will **add max health**. Instead if you die, you will **lose max health**. I didn't add config for the plugin, because the man who want me to make this had already told me how many healths need to add/remove.
- **InvitationCode**: **My first plugin**. It will allow old players get their own invitation code and share with new players. If new player use this invitation code, they will both get reward. A Chinese Minecraft server owner provided the idea for me.
- **JoinReward**: You can **give items** to the player who is **new to the server** by this plugin. Easy to config and very useful for server.
- **LoginReward**: Not the same as JoinReward, you can **give items** to a **specified player** when he join the server(old player or new player). When a player is offline, you can set items that you want to give to him. When he **join the server, he will get the items that you set**. You can both use command or modify file to change each player items list.
- **LoginTeleport**: You can **edit the position when player join the server** using command. Simple lol.
- **RankAdvanced**: The characteristic of this plugin is that you can use three different ways to store data. Include yaml files, SQLite and MySQL. Because this is made for server, rank name is already known. Player can get points by using command. And if they get enought points, they will get a new rank.
- **RecordBlock**: This plugin **record the amount of every player break and place blocks**. It will record every 6 hours in different files.
- **RollBossBar**: You can make **custom bossbar** with this plugin.
- **Survey**: This plugin can **give players survey** when they kill enough players. You can modify questions and survey interval times. And the answer will save to the MySQL. By using this plugin, you can get players' thinking easily. If player quit the server when doing survey, they can continue the survey when they rejoin the game!

### Large plugins:

- **QuestsPlugin**: This plugin is for quests in server and it is highly customizable. You can customize different quests with its name, actions, rewards and so on. And the menu of categories and quests can also be customized! You can change button name, icon**(support HeadDatabase plugin!)**, lore, glowing in config.yml. I am going to make more details and publish it to the Internet!
- **VillagerShop**: 

## Other I want to say

Because I am Chinese, some plugins contain Chinese character. If you can't understand, contact me.

With many hard working that I can make lots of plugins.
