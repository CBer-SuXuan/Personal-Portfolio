# plugins-for-servers
This repository contains the plugins that I have made for other servers so far. Although they are small plugins, I think it can show my ability on plugin making!


Details are as followed:
- **ChangeServer**: BungeeCord plugin. It will allow players join in the specified server if other servers suddenly stop. Avoid making player rejoin the server.
- **CustomInfo**: BungeeCord plugin. Allow you to change **motd, max player, info in front of the server icon, hower info** to what you want, even it can use color on them!
- **HeartCraft**: A easy plugin for server. When you eat golden apple / enchant golden apple, it will **add max health**. Instead if you die, you will **lose max health**. I didn't add config for the plugin, because the man who want me to make this had already told me how many healths need to add.
- **InvitationCode**: **My first plugin**. It will allow old players get their own invitation code and share with new players. If new player use this invitation code, they will both get reward. A Chinese Minecraft server owner provided the idea for me.
- **JoinReward**: You can **give items** to the player who is **new to the server** by this plugin. Easy to config and very useful for server.
- **LoginReward**: Not the same as JoinReward, you can **give items** to a **specified player** when he join the server(old player or new player). When a player is offline, you can set items that you want to give to him. When he **join the server, he will get the items that you set**. You can both use command or modify file to change each player items list.
- **LoginTeleport**: You can **edit the position when player join the server** using command.

Because I am Chinese, some plugins contain Chinese character. If you can't understand, contact me with Discord "cber_suxuan".
